* popup-computer

A computed popup attack profile generator for use with Falcon BMS.

** How to use

Go [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/451150/popup-computer/index.html][here]] and follow the directions.

** Why shouldn't I just use [[http://www.weapondeliveryplanner.nl/][Weapon Delivery Planner]]?

You should: it's awesome. I wrote this because I got interested in the
problem of computed popup attacks. Right now my tool differs only very
slightly from the attacks you can plan in WDP, and WDP offers *much*
more capability.

I may, in time, add capabilities beyond what WDP offers, but that's
not really the case right now. That said, I'm interested in hearing
your feedback if you happen to try my version.
